# Rides for Rewards

## Problem Statement

The ridership of L.A. Metro has been falling for the past several years. Create and app that would encourage people to take public transit.

## Solution

Reward for Metro rides at affiliate businesses

- The app uses a point-system to give riders rewards that can be cashed in/ 
  used at affiliate businesses for products based on stops/ distanced travelled/ locations

- incentive to use Metro

## User Persona

- Richard Snyder from this [LA Times article](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-bus-ridership-study-20170518-story.html).

- Occupation : video game tester

- Income: $30-40K a year

- Metro History : used to commute 2 hours each way from Canoga Park
  to Torrance until he moved to North Hollywood to be closer to train service
  
- Interests : video games, tech gadgets, podcasts, burritos, pizza, beer

- Motivation to use App : 
  * Taking metro anyway, may as well earn free stuff 
  * Save money by spending less on both needs (food) and toys (tech stuff)
  
- Benefits from his Using App : 
  * Metro gains loyalty & mitigates negative sentiment about long wait times
  * Local businesses gain awareness, potentially a new customer, frequency of use while he waits for train/bus 
  * May provide discouragement from seeking alternatives (Uber/Lyft)
